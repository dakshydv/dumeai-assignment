# Project Setup Instructions

## Project Approach

This project is designed to be robust, secure, and scalable, leveraging modern web technologies and best practices:

1. **Modern Stack**: Built with Next.js for server-side rendering and a React-based UI, ensuring fast performance and SEO benefits.
2. **Authentication**: Uses NextAuth for secure, flexible, and extensible user authentication flows.
3. **Environment Configuration**: Employs environment variables for sensitive data and configuration, making the app adaptable to different environments (development, staging, production).
4. **Database Integration**: Connects to a MongoDB database for persistent, scalable, and reliable data storage.
5. **Component Reusability**: Organizes UI components for reusability and maintainability, reducing code duplication and improving development efficiency.
6. **Developer Experience**: Provides clear setup instructions, code organization, and dependency management to streamline onboarding and collaboration.

This approach ensures a solid foundation for building, maintaining, and scaling the application.

## Approach

The setup process ensures all dependencies are installed, environment variables are configured, authentication is secured, and the database is ready. This allows you to run and develop the project smoothly.

## Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Run the following command to install all required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Copy the example environment file to create your own local configuration:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Generate NextAuth Secret**

   Generate a secure secret for NextAuth by running:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

   Copy the generated value and paste it into the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` field in your `.env` file.

4. **Create a MongoDB Cluster**

   Set up a MongoDB cluster (e.g., using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)).

   Update your `.env` file with the connection string for your cluster.

5. **Start the Development Server**

   Run the following command to start the app in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Your project should now be running locally!
